# AI-Driven Mythology Generators

Welcome to the **AI-Driven Mythology Generators** project. This initiative is an ambitious exploration into generative deep learning, with the goal of creating entirely new mythologies, languages, deities, rituals, and cultures from scratch using cutting-edge AI models.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project uses a blend of narrative GANs, hierarchical RNNs, and simulated cultural evolution to:

* Invent **fictional languages**.
* Generate **mythical gods and pantheons**.
* Simulate **rituals and ancient ceremonies**.
* Track the **evolution of cultures and religions** across time.

---

## ðŸ”§ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikosane/ai_myth_generator.git
cd ai_myth_generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ§  Core Technologies

* **Narrative GANs**: For structured story creation
* **Hierarchical RNNs**: For layered story generation (chapters, events, symbols)
* **Custom Language Models**: For phonetic, morphological, and syntactic creation of fictional languages
* **Cultural Evolution Simulations**: To model god conflicts, language drift, ritual development

## ðŸ›  How to Use

```bash
# Run CLI to generate a new mythology
python run.py --generate

# Simulate a timeline of cultural evolution
python run.py --simulate
```
